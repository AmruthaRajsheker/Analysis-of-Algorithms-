### **QA101: Outline the General Plan and Steps for Analyzing Recurrence Relations with Example**

The algorithm analysis framework comprises the following critical steps:

1. **Measuring an Input‚Äôs Size**
   This involves quantifying the problem size using variables such as `n`, which often refers to the number of elements in the input dataset.

2. **Units for Measuring Running Time**
   The running time is typically measured in terms of the number of primitive operations (e.g., additions, comparisons) executed.

3. **Orders of Growth**
   This refers to the classification of algorithms based on how their running time or space requirements grow as a function of input size. It includes polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, and constant time complexities.

4. **Worst-Case, Best-Case, and Average-Case Efficiencies**
   These efficiency classes provide insight into the performance of the algorithm under different input conditions.

---

### **QA102: Discuss Average, Best-Case, and Worst-Case Efficiency of an Algorithm**

* **Best-Case Efficiency:**
  Refers to the minimum resources (time, space) required for execution. It denotes the most optimal input scenario.

* **Worst-Case Efficiency:**
  Refers to the maximum resources required, representing the least favorable input case.

* **Average-Case Efficiency:**
  Represents the expected resource utilization across all possible inputs, weighted by their probability of occurrence.

---

### **QA103: Define Time Complexity and Space Complexity. Write an Algorithm to Print the Fibonacci Series Recursively and Find the Space Required by that Algorithm**

* **Time Complexity:**
  Time complexity quantifies the execution time of an algorithm relative to the input size `n`.

* **Space Complexity:**
  Space complexity quantifies the total memory consumed by an algorithm as a function of the input size.

#### **Algorithm: Recursive Fibonacci**

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

n = 10
print(f"The first {n} numbers in the Fibonacci series are:")
for i in range(n):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=" ")
```

**Space Required:**
Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack. The maximum depth of recursion is `O(n)`, hence space complexity = **O(n)**.

---

### **QA104: What is the Time Complexity of the Function `fun()`?**

```python
def fun(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    i = n
    while i > 0:
        for j in range(i):
            count += 1
        i //= 2
    return count
```

**Analysis:**
The inner loop runs `i` times, where `i` decreases by half each iteration.

So, total operations:
n + n/2 + n/4 + ... + 1
‚â§ n(1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...)
\= 2n

**Time Complexity: O(n)**

---

### **QA105: Prove that T(n) = n¬≥ + 20n + 1 is O(n‚Å¥)**

**Ans** :

1. **Recall Big-O definition:**
   Find constants $c > 0$ and $n_0 > 0$ such that

    $T(n) \leq c \cdot n^4, \quad \forall n \geq n_0$

2. **Start with given function:**

    $T(n) = n^3 + 20n + 1$

3. **Compare each term to $n^4$:**

    $n^3 \leq n^4$ for all $n \geq 1$

    $20n \leq 20 n^4$ for all $n \geq 1$

    $1 \leq n^4$ for all $n \geq 1$

5. **Sum inequalities:**

    $n^3 + 20n + 1 \leq n^4 + 20 n^4 + n^4 = 22 n^4$

6. **Choose constants:**

    $$c = 22, \quad n_0 = 1$$

7. **Conclude:**
   For all $n \geq n_0$,

   $$T(n) \leq c \cdot n^4$$

Therefore, $T(n) = O(n^4)$


---

### **QA106: What is the Output of the Following Code?**

```python
def my_recursive_function(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print(n, end=" ")
    my_recursive_function(n - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_recursive_function(5)
```

**Output:**
`5 4 3 2 1`

**Explanation:**
The function prints `n` and recursively calls itself with `n - 1` until `n` becomes 0, unwinding the recursion in reverse order.

---

### **QA107: Define the Big Theta (Œò) Notation and Its Properties**

**Big Theta (Œò) Notation:**
* Œò notation provides a **tight bound** on the growth rate of a function. It implies that the function is bounded both **above and below asymptotically**, i.e., it grows at the same rate as the comparison function.
* Big Theta (Œò) notation gives a *tight bound* on an algorithm's running time, representing both the upper and lower bounds.

Formally,

$$f(n) = Œò(g(n)) \text{ if } \exists \ c_1, c_2 > 0, n_0 \text{ such that } c_1g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2g(n), \forall n \geq n_0$$

**Properties:**

* Gives exact growth rate
* Ignores constants and lower-order terms
* If $f(n) = Œò(g(n))$, then $g(n) = Œò(f(n))$ (Symmetric)


---

### **QA108: Define Œ© (Omega) Notation and List Its Properties**

**Omega Notation (Œ©):**
* Œ© notation denotes the **lower bound** of an algorithm's running time. It is used to describe the **best-case scenario** or minimum time the algorithm will take.
* Big Omega (Œ©) notation provides a **lower bound** on the growth rate of an algorithm.
* It describes the **best-case** performance.

Formally,

$$f(n) = \Omega(g(n)) \text{ if } \exists \ c > 0, n_0 > 0 \text{ such that } f(n) \geq c \cdot g(n), \forall n \geq n_0$$

**Properties:**

* Represents **best-case** time complexity
* Ignores constant factors
* If $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$, then $g(n)$ is a lower bound for $f(n)$
* Transitive: If $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ and $g(n) = \Omega(h(n))$, then $f(n) = \Omega(h(n))$


---


### **QA201: Analyze the Time Efficiency and Drawbacks of Merge Sort Algorithm**

**Time Complexity:**

* **Best Case:** Œ©(n log n)
* **Average Case:** Œò(n log n)
* **Worst Case:** O(n log n)

**Space Complexity:**

* Merge Sort requires **O(n)** additional space for temporary arrays during the merge operation.

**Drawbacks:**

* **High Space Overhead:** Uses extra space proportional to input size, which impacts performance on memory-constrained systems.
* **Less Efficient for Small Inputs:** Performs slower than simpler algorithms like Insertion Sort for smaller datasets due to recursive overhead.
* **No Early Termination:** Processes all elements even if the array is already sorted.
* **Not In-Place:** Unlike Quick Sort, Merge Sort does not sort in place.

---

### **QA202: Examine a Brute Force Algorithm for Counting the Number of Vowels in a Given Text**

```python
def count_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example Usage
input_text = "Hello, how are you?"
num_vowels = count_vowels(input_text)
print(f"The number of vowels in the text is: {num_vowels}")
```

**Approach:**
A brute-force strategy that sequentially checks each character in the input against all known vowel characters.

**Time Complexity:**

* **O(n)**, where *n* is the length of the input string.

**Drawback:**

* Does not scale well for very large texts and lacks optimization techniques like hashing or lookup tables.

üîç **Step-by-Step using Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

We initialize distances from `a` as:

| Node | Distance from `a` | Predecessor |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| a    | 0                 | ‚Äî           |
| b    | ‚àû                 | ‚Äî           |
| c    | ‚àû                 | ‚Äî           |
| d    | ‚àû                 | ‚Äî           |
| e    | ‚àû                 | ‚Äî           |



 ‚úÖ **Iteration 1 (Relax all edges):**

* a ‚Üí b (5): `b = 0 + 5 = 5`, Predecessor of `b` = `a`
* a ‚Üí d (1): `d = 0 + 1 = 1`, Predecessor of `d` = `a`
* a ‚Üí e (2): `e = 0 + 2 = 2`, Predecessor of `e` = `a`
* b ‚Üí c (3): `c = 5 + 3 = 8`, Predecessor = `b`
* b ‚Üí d (-2): `d = 5 - 2 = 3` ‚Üí **not updated (current d = 1)**
* c ‚Üí e (-7): `e = 8 - 7 = 1`, Predecessor = `c`
* d ‚Üí e (-4): `e = 1 - 4 = -3`, Predecessor = `d`

| Node | Distance | Predecessor |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| a    | 0        | ‚Äî           |
| b    | 5        | a           |
| c    | 8        | b           |
| d    | 1        | a           |
| e    | -3       | d           |



‚úÖ **Iteration 2:**

* b ‚Üí c (3): `c = 5 + 3 = 8` (no change)
* b ‚Üí d (-2): `d = 5 - 2 = 3` (no update)
* c ‚Üí e (-7): `e = 8 - 7 = 1` (no update, e = -3)
* d ‚Üí e (-4): `e = 1 - 4 = -3` (no update)

‚Üí No changes in distances.



üîö **Final Path Trace (from `e` to `a` via predecessors):**

* `e` ‚Üê `d` ‚Üê `a`

* **Minimum Cost Path:** `a ‚Üí d ‚Üí e`

* **Intermediate Vertex:** Only `d`

* **Answer:**  **1 intermediate vertex is required** (node `d`) to travel from `a` to `e` at **minimum cost** of **‚àí3**.

### **QA204: Differentiate Linear Search Technique from Binary Search Technique**

| Feature                 | Linear Search             | Binary Search                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Data Requirement**    | Works on unsorted arrays  | Requires sorted arrays                  |
| **Time Complexity**     | O(n)                      | O(log n)                                |
| **Implementation**      | Simple                    | Slightly complex due to mid-point logic |
| **Use Case**            | Small/unsorted datasets   | Large/sorted datasets                   |
| **Worst-Case Scenario** | Last element or not found | Recursively splits till found/not found |

---

### **QA205: Discuss the Processing Steps in Merge Sort**

Merge Sort operates through three key stages under the **Divide and Conquer** paradigm:

1. **Divide Phase:**

   * Recursively split the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element.
   * Base case: array of size one (already sorted).

2. **Conquer Phase (Sort and Merge):**

   * Merge adjacent subarrays by comparing elements and placing them in order.
   * Recursion continues until all levels are merged.

3. **Combine Phase:**

   * Final merge produces the fully sorted array by combining two large sorted halves.

---

### **QA206: List the General Plan of Divide and Conquer Algorithm**

The Divide and Conquer approach follows three systematic phases:

1. **Divide:**

   * Partition the problem into sub-problems of similar nature.

2. **Conquer:**

   * Solve the sub-problems recursively or directly if sufficiently small.

3. **Combine:**

   * Integrate the solutions of the sub-problems to resolve the original problem.

Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, and Matrix Multiplication algorithms.

---

### **QA207: Examine the Average Number of Key Comparisons for Sequential Search on `n` Items**

**Total Comparisons:**

* If the desired element is at position `i`, it takes `i` comparisons.
* Total comparisons for all positions:

  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
  $$

**Average Case Comparisons:**

  $$
  \text{Average} = \frac{n(n + 1)/2}{n} = \frac{n + 1}{2}
  $$

**Best Case Time Complexity:**

* **O(1)** (element found at the first position)

**Worst Case Time Complexity:**

* **O(n)** (element at last position or not found)

---

### **QA208: Illustrate Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) with Example**

**Definition:**
A Minimum Spanning Tree is a subset of edges in a **connected, undirected, weighted graph** that connects all vertices with the **minimum total edge weight** and **no cycles**.

**Example:**

Consider the following weighted graph:

```
    A
   / \
  1   3
 B-----C
   \  /
    4
    D
```

**Using Kruskal‚Äôs or Prim‚Äôs Algorithm:**

* MST includes edges: A‚ÄìB (1), B‚ÄìC (3), C‚ÄìD (4)
* **Total Cost = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8**

**Properties:**

* Contains (V ‚àí 1) edges where V is the number of vertices.
* No cycles; all vertices are connected.

---


### **QA301: Differentiate DFS and BFS**

* **Depth-First Search (DFS):**

  * Explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  * Implemented via recursion or an explicit stack.
  * Memory-efficient relative to BFS.
  * Does **not** guarantee the shortest path in graphs.

* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**

  * Explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving deeper.
  * Utilizes a queue data structure.
  * Requires more memory due to level-wise exploration.
  * Guarantees finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

---

### **QA302: Dynamic Programming Algorithm to Make 1655 Using Coins {1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5}**

*Objective:* Minimize the number of coins to sum up to 1655 using given denominations.

*Approach:*

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `1655 + 1` with a high value (e.g., infinity) except `dp[0] = 0`.
2. For each amount `i` from 1 to 1655:

   * For each coin `c` in {1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5}:

     * If `i - c >= 0`, update `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1)`.
3. The result is `dp[1655]` which gives the minimum coins needed.

*Pseudocode:*

```
dp[0] = 0  
for i in 1 to 1655:  
    dp[i] = ‚àû  
    for coin in coins:  
        if i - coin >= 0 and dp[i - coin] != ‚àû:  
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)  
return dp[1655]
```

Given sequence: `{10, -10, 12, 9, 10, 15, 13, 14}`

* The longest increasing subsequence is: `{-10, 9, 10, 13, 14}`
* This subsequence is strictly increasing and has the maximum length compared to others in the sequence.

### **QA304: Minimum Cost from Vertex ‚Äòb‚Äô to ‚Äòf‚Äô in the Given Graph**

* Path: `b ‚Üí g ‚Üí e ‚Üí f`
* Costs:

  * `b to g` = 1
  * `g to e` = 4
  * `e to f` = 1
* **Total minimum cost = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6**

---

### **QA305: Comparison Between Brute Force and Dynamic Programming**

| Feature              | Brute Force                                            | Dynamic Programming (DP)                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**       | Exhaustively tries all possible solutions.             | Decomposes problems into overlapping subproblems, solves each once, and caches results.           |
| **Approach**         | Unoptimized exhaustive search.                         | Utilizes memoization or tabulation to optimize recursive or iterative solutions.                  |
| **Time Complexity**  | Typically exponential (`O(2^n)` or factorial `O(n!)`). | Typically polynomial or logarithmic, depending on problem (e.g., `O(n)`, `O(n^2)`, `O(n log n)`). |
| **Space Complexity** | Generally low unless recursive calls stack up.         | Higher due to storage of intermediate results (memoization/table).                                |

---

### **QA306: Closest Pair Problem**

* A classical problem in computational geometry.
* Goal: Identify the two points with the minimum Euclidean distance from a set of points in 2D or higher-dimensional space.
* Efficient algorithms exist with time complexity `O(n log n)` utilizing divide and conquer.

---

### **QA307: Advantages of Floyd‚Äôs Algorithm**

* Computes shortest paths between **all pairs** of vertices simultaneously (All-Pairs Shortest Path).
* Handles graphs with **negative edge weights**, provided there are **no negative weight cycles**.
* Well-suited for dense graphs and scenarios requiring comprehensive shortest path information.

---

### **QA308: Coin Change Problem Explained with Example**

* Problem: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, determine the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.
* If the amount cannot be formed, return -1.
* Example: For coins `[1, 2, 5]` and amount `11`, the minimum coins needed is `3` (5 + 5 + 1 = 11).

---

### **QA401: Define the Stable Marriage Problem (SMP)**
The Stable Marriage Problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem involving two equally sized sets of participants (e.g., men and women), each with strict preference rankings over members of the opposite set. The objective is to produce a matching where no pair of individuals would both prefer each other over their assigned partners‚Äîensuring stability by eliminating incentive for any pair to deviate from the matching.

---

### **QA402: State Space Tree for Subset Sum Problem ({3,5,6,7}, Target Sum = 15)**
The Subset Sum Problem entails identifying a subset of given elements whose sum equals a specified target value.

**Algorithmic Steps:**

1. Start with an empty subset at the root node.
2. Iteratively add the next element from the set to the current subset and evaluate the sum.
3. If the subset sum equals the target (15), record the subset as a solution and terminate that branch.
4. If the sum exceeds the target or all elements have been considered, backtrack to explore alternative subsets.
5. Continue this exploration until all feasible subsets are evaluated or no solution exists.

**State Space Tree Definition:**
A tree data structure representing all possible states (partial or complete subsets), with the root as the initial empty set and leaves representing terminal states (solution or dead-ends).

*Note:* A detailed tree diagram would depict nodes representing subsets at each level branching by inclusion or exclusion of the next element (3, then 5, then 6, then 7).

---

### **QA403: Solution Approach for the N-Queen Problem**
The N-Queen problem requires placing N queens on an N√óN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

**Backtracking Strategy:**

* Place a queen in the first row and iterate through each column.
* For each valid position (not attacked by any previously placed queen), place the queen and proceed to the next row.
* If no valid position is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and move the queen to the next possible column.
* Continue until all queens are successfully placed without conflicts.

---

### **QA404: Define Bipartite Graphs**
A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets such that every edge connects a vertex from one subset to a vertex in the other, and no edges exist between vertices within the same subset. This structure is a special case of k-partite graphs (where k=2). Bipartite graphs are foundational in modeling relationships with two distinct classes of entities.

---

### **QA405: Principle of Backtracking**
Backtracking is a systematic algorithmic paradigm for solving constraint satisfaction problems by incrementally constructing candidate solutions and abandoning partial candidates as soon as they violate constraints.

**Key Characteristics:**

* Utilizes recursion to explore solution space depth-first.
* Prunes infeasible paths early to reduce search space.
* Applicable in decision problems (finding any feasible solution), optimization problems (finding the best solution), and enumeration problems (finding all feasible solutions).
* Operates by progressing through a sequence of checkpoints, backtracking whenever a dead-end is encountered.

---

### **QA406: Illustrate State Space Tree with Example**
A state space tree represents the complete search space of a problem as a tree, where:

* The **root** node represents the initial state (e.g., empty subset or no queens placed).
* **Intermediate nodes** represent partial solutions or states.
* **Leaf nodes** represent terminal states, either solutions or dead-ends.

*Example:* For a subset sum problem with elements {3,5}, the root is empty set, branching into subsets including/excluding 3, then further branching including/excluding 5.

### **QA407: Examine the Knapsack Problem**
The Knapsack Problem is a canonical combinatorial optimization challenge where a set of items, each with an associated weight and value, must be selected to maximize total value without exceeding a fixed capacity constraint. It epitomizes resource allocation under constraints and serves as a benchmark for dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and approximation strategies.

---

### **QA408: Determine the Chromatic Number of the Given Graph**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da62dfff-a183-423f-a1e0-761ed919b7ca)

To determine the **chromatic number** of the given graph, we need to find the **minimum number of colors** required to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.


**Step-by-step analysis:**

From the image:

* There is a **central vertex** connected to **four outer vertices**.
* The outer vertices are **not connected to each other**.

This structure is called a **star graph**, denoted as $K_{1,4}$ ‚Äî one central node connected to 4 leaf nodes.

**Chromatic Number:**

* The **central vertex** must have its own color.
* Each of the **outer vertices** is only connected to the central vertex, so they can all share the **same second color**.

Therefore, only **2 colors** are required.

**QA501: Describe Randomized and Parallel Algorithms**

* **Randomized Algorithms:**
  These algorithms incorporate random number generation or probabilistic decisions within their logic to optimize performance metrics such as execution time or memory usage. By introducing randomness, they often achieve faster average-case performance or simplified implementation at the expense of occasional variability in output or runtime guarantees.

* **Parallel Algorithms:**
  Designed to leverage multiple processors or cores to divide and conquer computational tasks, parallel algorithms aim to accelerate problem-solving beyond the limits of sequential execution. Their performance evaluation typically focuses on:

  * **Time complexity (Execution time):** How quickly the task completes using parallel resources.
  * **Processor count:** Number of parallel units engaged.
  * **Total cost:** Aggregate computational effort (time √ó processors), balancing efficiency against resource consumption.

**QA502: Concept of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**

TSP is a quintessential combinatorial optimization problem involving a set of cities (nodes) and the objective to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin. The salesman‚Äôs objective is to minimize total travel cost and distance, which is inherently NP-hard, posing significant challenges for exact solutions at scale.

---

**QA503: What is an NP-Hard Problem?**

A problem is classified as **NP-hard** if every problem in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) can be polynomial-time reduced to it. Informally, solving an NP-hard problem efficiently would imply an efficient solution for all NP problems, but NP-hardness does not require the problem itself to be in NP (i.e., verifiable in polynomial time).

---

**QA504: Knapsack Problem ‚Äî Maximize Value with Weight Limit 60**

Given:

* Weights: {20, 30, 40, 70}
* Values: {70, 80, 90, 200}
* Maximum capacity: 60

**Optimal Solution:**
Select items 1 (weight 20, value 70) and 2 (weight 30, value 80), totaling 50 weight and 150 value, or items 1 and 3 (weights 20 + 40 = 60, values 70 + 90 = 160).

The **maximum value achievable is 160**, by choosing items 1 and 3, fully utilizing the knapsack capacity without exceeding it.

**QA505: Differentiate Between Polynomial and Non-Polynomial Time**

| Criterion        | Polynomial Time                                                                                         | Non-Polynomial Time                                                                                    |

| **Practicality** | Generally considered efficient and tractable.                                                           | Typically infeasible for large inputs due to explosive growth in runtime.                              |
| **Examples**     | Sorting algorithms like mergesort (O(n log n)), graph traversal (O(V+E)).                               | Brute-force solutions for NP-complete problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem.                   |

**QA506: Explain Polynomial Reduction with Example**

Polynomial reduction is a technique to demonstrate that problem A is no harder than problem B by converting any instance of A into an instance of B in polynomial time. This implies that an efficient solution for B translates into an efficient solution for A.

*Example:* Reducing the **Hamiltonian Path** problem to the **Travelling Salesman Problem** by encoding path constraints as weighted edges, such that solving TSP yields a solution to Hamiltonian Path.

**QA508: State and Explain Cook‚Äôs Theorem**

Cook‚Äôs Theorem establishes that the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is **NP-Complete**, marking it as the first problem proven to be NP-Complete. This seminal result underpins complexity theory by demonstrating that any problem in NP can be reduced to SAT in polynomial time, thereby positioning SAT as a cornerstone for NP-Completeness and computational intractability analysis.
