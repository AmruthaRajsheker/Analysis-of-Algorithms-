## **EXPERIMENT 3C: **



### **AIM:**

To implement a dynamic programming solution that determines the **length of the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS)** in a given sequence.



### **PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest subsequence which is a palindrome. A subsequence need not be contiguous but must preserve the order of characters.



### **ALGORITHM:**

1. Initialize a 2D matrix `dp[n][n]`, where `dp[i][j]` will represent the length of LPS in `s[i..j]`.
2. All substrings of length 1 are palindromic â‡’ `dp[i][i] = 1`
3. Iterate over increasing lengths `cl = 2 to n`.
4. For each substring `s[i..j]`:

   * If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]`
   * Else, take the max of excluding either end: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
5. Return `dp[0][n-1]` which represents the LPS of the full string.



### **PYTHON PROGRAM:**

```python
def lps(s):
    n=len(s)
    dp=[[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range (n):
        dp[i][i]=1
    for cl in range (2,n+1):
        for i in range (n-cl+1):
            j=i+cl-1
            if s[i]==s[j]:
                dp[i][j]=2+dp[i+1][j-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j]=max(dp[i+1][j],dp[i][j-1])
    return dp[0][n-1]
s=input().strip()
print("The length of the LPS is",lps(s))
                    
```
