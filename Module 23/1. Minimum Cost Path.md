## **EXPERIMENT 5A: MINIMUM COST PATH USING DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING**



### **AIM:**

To design and implement a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum cost path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, where movement is allowed only to the right, down, or diagonally right-down.



### **ALGORITHM:**

1. Initialize a DP matrix `cost` of the same dimension as the input grid.
2. Set `cost[0][0]` to the value of the starting cell.
3. Fill the first row and first column by accumulating costs from left and top respectively.
4. For every other cell, calculate the minimum cost by considering:

   * Cost from the cell above (down move),
   * Cost from the cell to the left (right move),
   * Cost from the diagonal cell (diagonal move).
5. The value in `cost[m-1][n-1]` will be the minimum cost path to the destination.



### **PROGRAM:**

```python
R=int(input())
C=int(input())
def minCost(cost,m,n):
    tc=[[0 for x in range (C)] for x in range(R)]
    tc[0][0]=cost[0][0]
    for i in range (1,m+1):
        tc[i][0]=tc[i-1][0]+cost[i][0]
    for j in range (1,n+1):
        tc[0][j]=tc[0][j-1]+cost[0][j]
    for i in range (1,m+1):
        for j in range (1,n+1):
            tc[i][j]=min(tc[i-1][j-1],tc[i-1][j],tc[i][j-1])+cost[i][j]
    return tc[m][n]
cost=[[1,2,3],[4,8,2],[1,5,3]]
print(minCost(cost,2,2))
```

### **TIME COMPLEXITY:**

* O(m \* n), where m and n are the dimensions of the cost matrix.



### **RESULT:**

The program efficiently computes the minimum cost path using dynamic programming by systematically evaluating all feasible paths and selecting the optimal path cost from the start to the destination.
