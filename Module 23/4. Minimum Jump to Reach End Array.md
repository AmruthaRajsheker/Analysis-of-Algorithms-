## **EXPERIMENT 4: MINIMUM JUMPS TO REACH END OF ARRAY (Dynamic Programming)**



### **AIM:**

To determine the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of a given array where each element represents the maximum jump length at that position, using a recursive strategy.



### **ALGORITHM:**

1. **Base Case 1:** If the start index equals the end index, no jumps are required — return 0.
2. **Base Case 2:** If the current element is 0, then it’s not possible to move forward — return ∞ (infinity).
3. **Recursive Step:**

   * For each reachable index from the current position, recursively compute the minimum jumps required from that index to the end.
   * Track the minimum of these values and increment it by 1 (for the current jump).
4. **Return** the minimum jump count from the starting index to the last index.



### **PROGRAM:**

```python
def minJumps(arr, l, h):
    if (h == l):
        return 0
    if (arr[l] == 0):
        return float('inf')
    min = float('inf')
    for i in range(l + 1, h + 1):
        if (i < l + arr[l] + 1):
            jumps = minJumps(arr, i, h)
            if (jumps != float('inf') and
                       jumps + 1 < min):
                min = jumps + 1
    return min
arr = []
n = int(input()) 
for i in range(n):
    arr.append(int(input()))
print('Minimum number of jumps to reach','end is', minJumps(arr, 0, n-1))
 
```

### **RESULT:**

The program computes the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array efficiently. However, the given implementation is **recursive and exponential in time complexity**, i.e., **O(2^n)** in the worst case. For large arrays, a **DP or greedy approach** is recommended to achieve optimal performance with **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.
