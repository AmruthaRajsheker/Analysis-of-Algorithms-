## **EXPERIMENT 2: COIN CHANGE PROBLEM USING DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING**



### **AIM:**

To implement a dynamic programming solution that computes the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a set of coin denominations.



### **ALGORITHM:**

1. Initialize a 2D DP table `table` where rows represent amounts from 0 to n (target) and columns represent coins available.
2. Set `table[0][j] = 1` for all j since there is exactly one way to make amount 0 (using no coins).
3. Iterate over all amounts `i` from 1 to n.
4. For each coin index `j`, compute the count as the sum of:

   * `x` = number of ways including the current coin `S[j]` (if `i - S[j] >= 0`).
   * `y` = number of ways excluding the current coin (using previous coins).
5. `table[n][m-1]` will store the total number of ways to make amount `n` using all `m` coins.



### **PROGRAM:**

```python
def count(S, m, n):
    table = [[0 for x in range(m)] for x in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(m):
        table[0][i] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(m):
            x = table[i - S[j]][j] if i-S[j] >= 0 else 0
            y = table[i][j-1] if j >= 1 else 0
            table[i][j] = x + y
    return table[n][m-1]
arr = []      
m = int(input())
n = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    arr.append(int(input()))
print(count(arr, m, n))
```

### **RESULT:**

The dynamic programming approach efficiently calculates the total number of distinct ways to form the target amount using the given coin denominations by building up from smaller subproblems, ensuring an optimal and scalable solution.
