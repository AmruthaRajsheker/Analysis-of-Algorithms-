## **EXPERIMENT NO: 3B**

### **AIM:**

To implement a **backtracking-based algorithm** for solving the **Hamiltonian Circuit Problem**, which finds a closed loop that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point.



### **ALGORITHM:**

1. **Start**
2. Define a graph using an adjacency matrix representation.
3. Initialize a path array with the first vertex as the starting point.
4. Define `is_safe(v, pos, path)` to:

   * Check if vertex `v` is adjacent to the last vertex in the path.
   * Ensure vertex `v` has not already been included in the path.
5. Define `hamiltonian_cycle_util(path, pos)`:

   * If all vertices are included and there is an edge from the last to the first, return `True`.
   * For each vertex, check if it can be added to the path.
   * Recurse to construct the path further.
   * Backtrack if no valid extension is found.
6. Driver function `hamiltonian_cycle()` initializes the path and invokes the utility.
7. Print the path if a Hamiltonian Circuit exists.
8. **Stop**



### **PROGRAM:**

```python
class Graph():
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.graph = [[0 for column in range(vertices)]
                            for row in range(vertices)]
        self.V = vertices
    def isSafe(self, v, pos, path):
        if self.graph[ path[pos-1] ][v] == 0:
            return False
        for vertex in path:
            if vertex == v:
                return False
 
        return True
    def hamCycleUtil(self, path, pos):
        if pos==self.V:
            if self.graph[path[pos - 1]][path[0]] == 1:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        for v in range(1, self.V):
            if self.isSafe(v, pos, path):
                path[pos] = v
                if self.hamCycleUtil(path, pos + 1):
                    return True
                path[pos]=-1
        return False
 
    def hamCycle(self):
        path = [-1] * self.V
        path[0] = 0
 
        if self.hamCycleUtil(path,1) == False:
            print ("Solution does not exist\n")
            return False
 
        self.printSolution(path)
        return True
 
    def printSolution(self, path):
        print ("Solution Exists: Following",
                 "is one Hamiltonian Cycle")
        for vertex in path:
            print (vertex, end = " ")
        print (path[0], "\n")
g1 = Graph(5)
g1.graph = [ [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
            [0, 1, 0, 0, 1,],[1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
            [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], ]
g1.hamCycle();
```

### **RESULT:**

The program accurately determines whether a **Hamiltonian Circuit** exists in a given graph using a **recursive backtracking approach**. It successfully returns a valid closed tour visiting each vertex exactly once, if such a cycle exists.
