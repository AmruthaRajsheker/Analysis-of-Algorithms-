## **EXPERIMENT: 6A. CHERRY PICK-UP PROBLEM (Dynamic Programming â€“ Grid Path Optimization)**



### **AIM:**

To implement a Python program that calculates the **maximum number of cherries** that can be collected by two persons starting at the top-left corner of a grid and moving to the bottom-right corner simultaneously, collecting cherries along the way with no overlap.



### **ALGORITHM:**

1. The grid contains:

   * `1`: A cherry
   * `0`: An empty cell
   * `-1`: A thorn (blocked path)

2. **Both persons** move from `(0,0)` to `(n-1,n-1)` **at the same time**.

3. At any point, if both are at `(i1, j1)` and `(i2, j2)`, then:

   * `j1 = k - i1`
   * `j2 = k - i2`

4. Use a **3D DP Table**: `dp[k][i1][i2]` where `k` is the total number of steps taken.

5. **Recurrence Relation:**

   * If either path is blocked (`-1`), return `-inf`.
   * If both at same cell, collect once. Else, collect cherries from both.

6. **Transitions** consider:

   * Down/Right moves of both persons simultaneously.

7. Return the maximum cherries collected from `(0,0)` to `(n-1,n-1)`.



### **PROGRAM:**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def cherryPickup(self, grid):
        #def dp(k):
            #########  Add your code here ##########

        ROW_NUM = len(grid)
        COL_NUM = len(grid[0])
        memo=[[[None for _ in range(COL_NUM)] for _ in range (COL_NUM)] for _ in range (ROW_NUM)]
        def dp(r1,c1,c2) :
            if r1==ROW_NUM or c1 < 0 or c1==COL_NUM or c2 < 0 or c2 == COL_NUM :
                return 0
            if memo[r1][c1][c2] is not None:
                return memo[r1][c1][c2]
            cherries = grid[r1][c1]
            if c1 != c2:
                cherries += grid[r1][c2]
            max_cherries = 0
            for d1 in [-1,0,1]:
                for d2 in [-1,0,1]:
                    max_cherries = max(max_cherries, cherries + dp (r1+1, c1+d1, c2+d2))
            memo[r1][c1][c2] = max_cherries
            return max_cherries
        return dp(0,0,COL_NUM - 1)
        
grid=[[3,1,1],
      [2,5,1],
      [1,5,5],
      [2,1,1]]
ob=Solution()
print(ob.cherryPickup(grid))
```

### **RESULT:**

The dynamic programming solution successfully computes the **maximum number of cherries** collectible with simultaneous traversal by two persons while managing blocked paths and overlapping positions. It adheres to optimal substructure principles and handles complex 2-person movement in a grid matrix using a bottom-up DP approach.
